## Overview

High architectural coupling is one of the leading causes of AI agent failure. When an agent modifies a "bottleneck" file with dozens of dependents, the resulting cascade of breakages often exceeds the agent's context window or reasoning capacity.

The **Change Amplification** analyzer computes graph metrics (fan-in, fan-out, and centrality) to identify these high-risk areas before they cause an "edit explosion."

### Language Support

- **Full Support:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, C#
- **Capabilities:** Fan-in/Fan-out analysis, blast radius prediction, hotspot detection.

## Features

- **Fan-Out Analysis**: Measures how many dependencies a file has (impact of external changes on this file).
- **Fan-In Analysis**: Measures how many files depend on this one (impact of changes in this file on the system).
- **Amplification Factor**: A weighted metric predicting the "blast radius" of a single line change.
- **Hotspot Detection**: Automatically flags files that should be refactored to reduce system-wide fragility.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @aiready/change-amplification
```

## Usage

This tool is designed to be run through the unified AIReady CLI.

```bash
# Scan for change amplification hotspots
aiready scan . --tools change-amplification

# Get specific results for a directory
aiready change-amplification ./src
```
