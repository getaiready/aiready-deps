## Overview

AI agents are only as good as the context they are given. The **Agent Grounding** analyzer evaluates how "groundable" your codebase is—checking if domain concepts are clearly defined and project structure carries semantic meaning that aids AI retrieval.

## Features

- **README Quality**: Analyzes if high-level project documentation provides sufficient context for agent reasoning.
- **Directory Semantics**: Checks if file structure follows industry patterns that AI models recognize.
- **Domain Consistency**: Detects if core business concepts are named consistently across different modules.
- **Context Boundaries**: Flags ambiguous boundaries where code for multiple domains is mixed together.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @aiready/agent-grounding
```

## Usage

This tool is designed to be run through the unified AIReady CLI.

```bash
# Scan for agent grounding quality
aiready scan . --tools agent-grounding
```
